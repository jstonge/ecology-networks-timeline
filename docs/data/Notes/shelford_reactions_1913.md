	abstract = {In the experimental control of gases, several and not one factor are commonly varied when gas is bubbled through water. Fishes are clearly affected by lack of oxygen; species usually die in the order of their relation to these factors in nature. Carbon dioxide, in concentrations probably used to produce reversals of reaction in some of the invertebrates, is poisonous to fishes, producing death very quickly. Fishes are not seriously affected by high nitrogen except when gas is in excess under one atmosphere pressure and comes off in bubbles on rough and warm objects; under these conditions gas bubble disease occurs. Fishes react negatively to a gradient of decreasing salts, nitrogen, and 1.5 cc. per liter of carbon dioxide, in combination; to a decrease in oxygen and other effects of boiling in combination; to carbon dioxide, to carbon dioxide in combination with the effects of boiling, and to carbon dioxide in boiled water at both ends of the experimental tank. The negative reaction of the fishes is evident through longer stays in the tap water end of the gradient tanks, by turnings back from the center, by risings to the surface, or by any combination of the three. Such reactionsmore » are accompanied by backing-starting reactions, coughing, gasping and gulping, directly proportional to the degree of avoidance of the treated water. The two species tried reacted negatively to a gradient of acetic acid in boiled water but some of the species did not react to ammonia in concentrations which produce death. Some fish establish 'preferences' or apparent preferences for one end of the experimental tanks for reasons obviously due to the experimental conditions. There is a large similarity of reaction among fishes that differ widely taxonomically. The carbon dioxide content of the water is probably the best single index of the suitability of the water for supportng fishes.« less},
